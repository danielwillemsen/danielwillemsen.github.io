### About me
I am currently a master student in Aerospace Engineering at the Delft University of Technology, working on my thesis about online learning for drone swarming. Previously I have interned at Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica, working on the interaction between planning and reinforcement learning, such as done by the AlphaZero line of algorithms.
